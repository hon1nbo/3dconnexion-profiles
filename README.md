# Tl;Dr

3dconnexion makes some nice 3d CAD mice in a variety of form factors and feature sets. Configuring these for various services is done in XML files to get full control without writing entire drivers.

These profiles are one-offs. They are typically set to use default keybinds for various functions unless otherwise noted.

Games, Media Editing, etc. More will be added as they are stable.

## Devices Tested (Current)
* SpaceMouse Pro (corded)


## Devices Tested (Former)
These devices are not currently available for testing, however profiles have been known to at least be partially functional.
